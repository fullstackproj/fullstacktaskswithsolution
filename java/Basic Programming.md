#### Task1: Write a Java program to swap two variables

#### Task2: Write a Java program to print the odd numbers from 1 to 20

#### Task3: Write a Java program to compute the sum of the first 100 prime numbers

#### Task4: Write a Java program to count the number of even and odd elements in a given array

#### Task5: Write a Java program to add all the digits of a given positive integer

#### Task6: Write a Java program to reverse an array of integer values

#### Task7: Write a Java program to find the duplicate values of an array of integer values

#### Task8: Write a Java program to find all pairs of elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified number.

#### Task9: Write a Java program to get the majority element from a given array of integers containing duplicates. 

* Majority element: A majority element is an element that appears more than n/2 times where n is the size of the array

#### Task10: Write a Java program to print all the LEADERS in the array.

* Note: An element is leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side.

#### Task11: Write a Java program to check if a given array contains a subarray with 0 sum.

```
Example:
Input :
nums1= { 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums2 = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums3 = { 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6 }
Output:
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: false
Does the said array contain a subarray with 0 sum: true
```
#### Task12: Write a Java program to print all sub-arrays with 0 sum present in a given array of integers.
```
Example:
Input :
nums1 = { 1, 3, -7, 3, 2, 3, 1, -3, -2, -2 }
nums2 = { 1, 2, -3, 4, 5, 6 }
nums3= { 1, 2, -2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
Output:
Sub-arrays with 0 sum : [1, 3, -7, 3]
Sub-arrays with 0 sum : [3, -7, 3, 2, 3, 1, -3, -2]
Sub-arrays with 0 sum : [1, 2, -3]
Sub-arrays with 0 sum : [2, -2]
